We will be using selenium to access browers

Use https://www.selenium.dev/documentation/en/selenium_installation/ to help with installing selenium

We will need to use the requests package. Use https://2.python-requests.org/en/master/user/install/#install to install.
We also need to use json package, comes with python already.
